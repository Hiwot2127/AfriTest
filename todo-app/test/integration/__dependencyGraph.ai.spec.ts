Okay, I need to see the code in `dependencyGraph` to create effective Jest integration tests.  Please provide the contents of the `dependencyGraph` file.

However, I can give you a general framework and examples based on common scenarios I've seen in modules named `dependencyGraph`.  I'll assume it does one or more of the following:

*   **Builds a graph:**  Represents dependencies between modules or nodes.
*   **Traverses a graph:**  Finds paths, cycles, or connected components.
*   **Detects circular dependencies:** Identifies circular references between modules.
*   **Analyzes dependencies:**  Provides statistics or insights about the graph.

Here's a Jest setup and test structure with common scenarios.  You'll need to adapt it *heavily* based on the actual code in your `dependencyGraph` file.

```javascript
// __tests__/dependencyGraph.test.js

const dependencyGraph = require('../dependencyGraph'); // Adjust the path as needed

describe('dependencyGraph Integration Tests', () => {

  beforeEach(() => {
    // Optional:  Reset or initialize the dependency graph before each test if needed.
    // For example, if the dependencyGraph module maintains some global state.
    // dependencyGraph.reset(); // If there's a reset function
  });

  it('should correctly build a simple dependency graph', () => {
    // Arrange
    const dependencies = {
      'A': ['B', 'C'],
      'B': ['D'],
      'C': ['D', 'E'],
      'D': [],
      'E': []
    };

    // Act
    const graph = dependencyGraph.buildGraph(dependencies); // Assuming a buildGraph function

    // Assert
    expect(graph.nodes.length).toBe(5); // Assuming you have a node representation
    expect(graph.edges.length).toBe(4);
    expect(graph.getNode('A').dependencies).toEqual(['B','C'])

    // More specific assertions about the structure of the graph...
  });

  it('should detect a circular dependency', () => {
    // Arrange
    const circularDependencies = {
      'A': ['B'],
      'B': ['C'],
      'C': ['A']
    };

    // Act
    const hasCycle = dependencyGraph.hasCircularDependency(circularDependencies); // Assuming a hasCircularDependency function

    // Assert
    expect(hasCycle).toBe(true);
  });

  it('should not detect a circular dependency when there isn\'t one', () => {
    // Arrange
    const nonCircularDependencies = {
      'A': ['B'],
      'B': ['C'],
      'C': []
    };

    // Act
    const hasCycle = dependencyGraph.hasCircularDependency(nonCircularDependencies);

    // Assert
    expect(hasCycle).toBe(false);
  });

  it('should find the correct topological order', () => {
    // Arrange
    const dependencies = {
      'A': ['B', 'C'],
      'B': ['D'],
      'C': ['D'],
      'D': []
    };

    // Act
    const topologicalOrder = dependencyGraph.topologicalSort(dependencies); // Assuming a topologicalSort function

    // Assert
    //There can be multiple valid orderings, so we must check multiple valid ones
    expect(topologicalOrder).toEqual(expect.arrayContaining(['A','B','C','D']));
    expect(topologicalOrder.indexOf('A')).toBeLessThan(topologicalOrder.indexOf('B'));
    expect(topologicalOrder.indexOf('A')).toBeLessThan(topologicalOrder.indexOf('C'));
    expect(topologicalOrder.indexOf('B')).toBeLessThan(topologicalOrder.indexOf('D'));
    expect(topologicalOrder.indexOf('C')).toBeLessThan(topologicalOrder.indexOf('D'));
  });

  it('should handle an empty dependency graph', () => {
    // Arrange
    const emptyDependencies = {};

    // Act
    const graph = dependencyGraph.buildGraph(emptyDependencies);

    // Assert
    expect(graph.nodes.length).toBe(0);
    expect(graph.edges.length).toBe(0);
  });

  it('should handle dependencies with self-references (if appropriate)', () => {
    const dependenciesWithSelfReference = {
      'A': ['A', 'B'],
      'B': []
    };

    const graph = dependencyGraph.buildGraph(dependenciesWithSelfReference);
    expect(graph.getNode('A').dependencies).toEqual(['A','B'])

    // Assert that the graph handles self-references correctly.  This depends on
    // how the dependencyGraph module is designed. It might ignore them, or it
    // might treat them as a dependency on itself.  Adjust the assertions
    // accordingly.
  });
});
```

**Explanation and Key Considerations:**

1.  **`require('../dependencyGraph')`:**  Make sure the path is correct relative to your test file.
2.  **`describe` block:** Groups related tests together.
3.  **`beforeEach` (Optional):**  Resets or initializes the dependency graph *if* your `dependencyGraph` module has any global state that persists between tests. This prevents tests from interfering with each other.  Remove this if not needed.
4.  **`it` blocks:**  Each `it` block represents a single test case.
5.  **Arrange, Act, Assert (AAA):**  Structure your tests this way for clarity:
    *   **Arrange:** Set up the test data and initial conditions.  Define the `dependencies` object.
    *   **Act:** Call the function you're testing from the `dependencyGraph` module (e.g., `dependencyGraph.buildGraph()`).
    *   **Assert:** Use Jest's `expect` assertions to verify that the function produced the expected results.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Adapt the Assertions:** The most critical part is adapting the `expect` assertions to match the *actual* output and behavior of your `dependencyGraph` module.  I've made assumptions about what functions might exist and how the data might be structured, but you'll need to examine your code to know for sure.
*   **Error Handling:** Add tests to cover error conditions (e.g., invalid input, missing dependencies).
*   **Edge Cases:** Consider edge cases like empty dependency lists, self-references, and large graphs.
*   **Integration vs. Unit Tests:** These are *integration* tests because they test the interaction of the different parts *within* the `dependencyGraph` module. If your module is very complex, you might also want *unit* tests that test each function in isolation.
*   **Dependency Injection (if applicable):** If your `dependencyGraph` module depends on other modules, consider using dependency injection to make it easier to mock those dependencies during testing.

**To Get the Best Results, Provide the `dependencyGraph` Code:**

Once you provide the code in your `dependencyGraph` file, I can give you much more specific and accurate Jest tests.  I'll be able to tailor the tests to the exact functions, data structures, and expected behaviors of your module.
