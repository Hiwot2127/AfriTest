Okay, I need more information to provide effective Jest integration tests. Please provide the content of the `./cli/commands` directory.  Specifically, I need to know:

1.  **What files are in the `./cli/commands` directory?**  Knowing the file names (e.g., `add.js`, `remove.js`, `list.js`, `index.js`) is crucial.
2.  **For each file, what functionality does it expose?**  For example, does it export functions, classes, or objects?  What arguments do these functions take, and what do they return or do as side effects?
3.  **What external dependencies does each file have?**  Does it use the file system (`fs`), network requests (`axios`, `node-fetch`), other modules within the project, or external libraries?
4.  **What is the overall purpose of the CLI commands?**  Knowing the domain (e.g., managing files, interacting with an API, manipulating data) will help me create realistic test scenarios.
5.  **What does the rest of the CLI environment look like?** Is there a central entrypoint script? Are there any configuration files involved?

Once you provide this information, I can give you specific Jest integration tests that cover common scenarios and edge cases.

**In the meantime, here are some *general* considerations for integration testing CLI commands:**

*   **Testing the CLI Entrypoint:** You'll likely have a main CLI entrypoint script (e.g., `index.js`, `cli.js`). Integration tests should execute this script with various command-line arguments and check the output, exit code, and side effects.
*   **Using `child_process`:**  The `child_process` module in Node.js is essential for running your CLI commands from within your Jest tests.  You'll typically use `exec` or `spawn` to execute the CLI script with arguments.
*   **Capturing Output:**  You'll need to capture the `stdout` (standard output) and `stderr` (standard error) streams from the `child_process` to verify the command's behavior.
*   **Mocking Dependencies (Use Sparingly):** While integration tests aim to test the *interaction* of components, you might need to mock certain external dependencies (like network requests or database interactions) to make your tests reliable and fast.  Use mocking strategically, focusing on dependencies that are outside the scope of what you want to integrate-test.
*   **Environment Variables:** Consider setting and testing the behavior of your CLI with different environment variables.
*   **File System Interaction:** If your CLI commands read or write files, you'll need to create temporary test directories and files, and clean them up after each test.  Libraries like `tmp` or `fs-extra` can be helpful for this.
*   **Error Handling:**  Test how your CLI commands handle invalid input, missing files, network errors, and other potential problems.
*   **Exit Codes:**  Verify that your CLI commands return the correct exit codes to indicate success or failure.  `0` usually signifies success, and non-zero values indicate errors.

**Example (Illustrative - Requires Adaptation):**

Let's assume you have a simple CLI command that adds two numbers:

`./cli/commands/add.js`:

```javascript
// ./cli/commands/add.js
function add(a, b) {
  const numA = parseInt(a, 10);
  const numB = parseInt(b, 10);

  if (isNaN(numA) || isNaN(numB)) {
    console.error("Error: Both arguments must be numbers.");
    process.exit(1);
  }

  const sum = numA + numB;
  console.log(sum);
  process.exit(0);
}

module.exports = add;
```

`./cli.js` (The main entrypoint):

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
const add = require('./cli/commands/add');

const args = process.argv.slice(2);

if (args.length !== 2) {
  console.error("Usage: cli <number1> <number2>");
  process.exit(1);
}

add(args[0], args[1]);
```

Here's a possible Jest integration test:

```javascript
// __tests__/cli.test.js
const { exec } = require('child_process');
const path = require('path');

const cliPath = path.join(__dirname, '../cli.js'); // Path to your CLI entrypoint

describe('CLI Integration Tests', () => {
  it('should add two numbers correctly', (done) => {
    exec(`node ${cliPath} 5 3`, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
      if (error) {
        console.error(`exec error: ${error}`);
        done(error); // Fail the test if there's an execution error
        return;
      }
      expect(stdout.trim()).toBe('8'); // Check the output
      expect(stderr).toBe('');           // No errors expected
      done();
    });
  });

  it('should handle non-numeric input', (done) => {
    exec(`node ${cliPath} a 3`, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
      expect(error).not.toBeNull(); // Expect an error
      expect(stderr).toContain('Error: Both arguments must be numbers.'); // Check error message
      done();
    });
  });

  it('should handle insufficient arguments', (done) => {
    exec(`node ${cliPath} 5`, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
      expect(error).not.toBeNull();
      expect(stderr).toContain('Usage: cli <number1> <number2>');
      done();
    });
  });
});
```

**Key points about this example:**

*   **`exec`:** Used to run the CLI command.
*   **`cliPath`:**  Ensures the correct path to the CLI entrypoint.
*   **`stdout`, `stderr`:** Captured to check the output and error messages.
*   **Error Handling:**  Tests for both successful execution and error conditions.
*   **`done()`:**  Used for asynchronous testing because `exec` is asynchronous. Jest needs to know when the test is complete.  You could also use `async/await` instead with some modifications to the `package.json` file.
*   **`path.join` and `__dirname`:** Help create an absolute path to the `cli.js` file so that the `exec` command can find it, regardless of where the tests are run from.

Remember to install `jest`: `npm install --save-dev jest` and configure your `package.json` to run Jest tests (e.g., `"test": "jest"` in the `scripts` section).

To provide you with more tailored Jest integration tests, please provide the details of your `./cli/commands` directory and the overall CLI structure.  I'll then be able to generate more relevant and helpful tests.
